A cat in a box animation project

## Getting Started

This project is a bit of playing with the animation properties in Flutter.

I created a box and a cat animation that when you tap on the screen, the cat goes outside the box.

You can clone this repo and then use ```flutter run``` in order to run the app in your device or favorite emulator.

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
